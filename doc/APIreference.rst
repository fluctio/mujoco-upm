This chapter is the reference manual for MuJoCo. It is generated from the header files included with MuJoCo, but also
contains additional text not available in the headers.

Type definitions
----------------

.. _tyPrimitive:

Primitive types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MuJoCo defines a large number of primitive types described here. Except for :ref:`mjtNum` and
:ref:`mjtByte`, all other primitive types are C enums used to define various integer constants. Note that the
rest of the API does not use these enum types directly. Instead it uses ints, and only the documentation/comments state
that certain ints correspond to certain enum types. This is because we want the API to be compiler-independent, and the
C standard does not dictate how many bytes must be used to represent an enum type. Nevertheless we recommend using these
types when calling the API functions (and letting the compiler do the enum-to-int type cast).

.. _mjtNum:

mjtNum
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #ifdef mjUSEDOUBLE
       typedef double mjtNum;
   #else
       typedef float mjtNum;
   #endif

| Defined in `mjtnum.h <https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/include/mujoco/mjtnum.h>`_

| This is the floating-point type used throughout the simulator. If the symbol ``mjUSEDOUBLE`` is defined in
  ``mjmodel.h``, this type is defined as ``double``, otherwise it is defined as ``float``. Currently only the
  double-precision version of MuJoCo is distributed, although the entire code base works with single-precision as well.
  We may release the single-precision version in the future for efficiency reasons, but the double-precision version
  will always be available. Thus it is safe to write user code assuming double precision. However, our preference is to
  write code that works with either single or double precision. To this end we provide math utility functions that are
  always defined with the correct floating-point type.

| Note that changing ``mjUSEDOUBLE`` in ``mjtnum.h`` will not change how the library was compiled, and instead will
  result in numerous link errors. In general, the header files distributed with precompiled MuJoCo should never be
  changed by the user.

.. _mjtByte:

.. _tyXMacro:

X Macros
^^^^^^^^

The X Macros are not needed in most user projects. They are used internally to allocate the model, and are also
available for users who know how to use this programming technique. See the header file `mjxmacro.h
<https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/include/mujoco/mjxmacro.h>`_ for the actual definitions. They are
particularly useful in writing MuJoCo wrappers for scripting languages, where dynamic structures matching the MuJoCo
data structures need to be constructed programmatically.

.. _Global-variables:

Global variables
----------------

.. _glError:

Error callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All user callbacks (i.e., global function pointers whose name starts with 'mjcb') are initially set to NULL, which
disables them and allows the default processing to take place. To install a callback, simply set the corresponding
global pointer to a user function of the correct type. Keep in mind that these are global and not model-specific. So if
you are simulating multiple models in parallel, they use the same set of callbacks.

.. _mju_user_error:

mju_user_error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern void (*mju_user_error)(const char*);

This is called from within the main error function :ref:`mju_error`. When installed, this function overrides the default
error processing. Once it prints error messages (or whatever else the user wants to do), it must **exit** the program.
MuJoCo is written with the assumption that mju_error will not return. If it does, the behavior of the software is
undefined.

.. _mju_user_warning:

mju_user_warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern void (*mju_user_warning)(const char*);

This is called from within the main warning function :ref:`mju_warning`. It is similar to the error handler, but instead
it must return without exiting the program.

.. _glMemory:

Memory callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of the memory callbacks is to allow the user to install custom memory allocation and deallocation
mechanisms. One example where we have found this to be useful is a MATLAB wrapper for MuJoCo, where mex files are
expected to use MATLAB's memory mechanism for permanent memory allocation.

.. _mju_user_malloc:

mju_user_malloc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern void* (*mju_user_malloc)(size_t);

If this is installed, the MuJoCo runtime will use it to allocate all heap memory it needs (instead of using aligned
malloc). The user allocator must allocate memory aligned on 8-byte boundaries. Note that the parser and compiler are
written in C++ and sometimes allocate memory with the "new" operator which bypasses this mechanism.

.. _mju_user_free:

mju_user_free
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern void (*mju_user_free)(void*);

If this is installed, MuJoCo will free any heap memory it allocated by calling this function (instead of using aligned
free).

.. _glPhysics:

Physics callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The physics callbacks are the main mechanism for modifying the behavior of the simulator, beyond setting various
  options. The options control the operation of the default pipeline, while callbacks extend the pipeline at
  well-defined places. This enables advanced users to implement many interesting functions which we have not thought of,
  while still taking advantage of the default pipeline. As with all other callbacks, there is no automated error
  checking - instead we assume that the authors of callback functions know what they are doing.

| Custom physics callbacks will often need parameters that are not standard in MJCF. This is largely why we have
  provided custom fields as well as user data arrays in MJCF. The idea is to "instrument" the MJCF model by entering the
  necessary user parameters, and then write callbacks that look for those parameters and perform the corresponding
  computations. We strongly encourage users to write callbacks that check the model for the presence of user parameters
  before accessing them - so that when a regular model is loaded, the callback disables itself automatically instead of
  causing the software to crash.

.. _mjcb_passive:

mjcb_passive
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfGeneric mjcb_passive;

This is used to implement a custom passive force in joint space; if the force is more naturally defined in Cartesian
space, use the end-effector Jacobian to map it to joint space. By "passive" we do not mean a force that does no positive
work (as in physics), but simply a force that depends only on position and velocity but not on control. There are
standard passive forces in MuJoCo arising from springs, dampers, viscosity and density of the medium. They are computed
in ``mjData.qfrc_passive`` before mjcb_passive is called. The user callback should add to this vector instead of
overwriting it (otherwise the standard passive forces will be lost).

.. _mjcb_control:

mjcb_control
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfGeneric mjcb_control;

This is the most commonly used callback. It implements a control law, by writing in the vector of controls
``mjData.ctrl``. It can also write in ``mjData.qfrc_applied`` and ``mjData.xfrc_applied``. The values written in these
vectors can depend on position, velocity and all other quantities derived from them, but cannot depend on contact forces
and other quantities that are computed after the control is specified. If the callback accesses the latter fields, their
values do not correspond to the current time step.

The control callback is called from within :ref:`mj_forward` and :ref:`mj_step`, just before the controls and applied
forces are needed. When using the RK integrator, it will be called 4 times per step. The alternative way of specifying
controls and applied forces is to set them before ``mj_step``, or use ``mj_step1`` and ``mj_step2``. The latter approach
allows setting the controls after the position and velocity computations have been performed by ``mj_step1``, allowing
these results to be utilized in computing the control (similar to using mjcb_control). However, the only way to change
the controls between sub-steps of the RK integrator is to define the control callback.

.. _mjcb_contactfilter:

mjcb_contactfilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfConFilt mjcb_contactfilter;

This callback can be used to replace MuJoCo's default collision filtering. When installed, this function is called for
each pair of geoms that have passed the broad-phase test (or are predefined geom pairs in the MJCF) and are candidates
for near-phase collision. The default processing uses the contype and conaffinity masks, the parent-child filter and
some other considerations related to welded bodies to decide if collision should be allowed. This callback replaces the
default processing, but keep in mind that the entire mechanism is being replaced. So for example if you still want to
take advantage of contype/conaffinity, you have to re-implement it in the callback.

.. _mjcb_sensor:

mjcb_sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfSensor mjcb_sensor;

This callback populates fields of ``mjData.sensordata`` corresponding to user-defined sensors. It is called if it is
installed and the model contains user-defined sensors. It is called once per compute stage (mjSTAGE_POS, mjSTAGE_VEL,
mjSTAGE_ACC) and must fill in all user sensor values for that stage. The user-defined sensors have dimensionality and
data types defined in the MJCF model which must be respected by the callback.

.. _mjcb_time:

mjcb_time
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfTime mjcb_time;

Installing this callback enables the built-in profiler, and keeps timing statistics in ``mjData.timer``. The return type
is mjtNum, while the time units are up to the user. :ref:`simulate.cc <saSimulate>` assumes the unit is 1 millisecond.
In order to be useful, the callback should use high-resolution timers with at least microsecond precision. This is
because the computations being timed are very fast.

.. _mjcb_act_dyn:

mjcb_act_dyn
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfAct mjcb_act_dyn;

This callback implements custom activation dynamics: it must return the value of ``mjData.act_dot`` for the specified
actuator. This is the time-derivative of the activation state vector ``mjData.act``. It is called for model actuators
with user dynamics (mjDYN_USER). If such actuators exist in the model but the callback is not installed, their
time-derivative is set to 0.

.. _mjcb_act_gain:

mjcb_act_gain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfAct mjcb_act_gain;

This callback implements custom actuator gains: it must return the gain for the specified actuator with
``mjModel.actuator_gaintype`` set to mjGAIN_USER. If such actuators exist in the model and this callback is not
installed, their gains are set to 1.

.. _mjcb_act_bias:

mjcb_act_bias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfAct mjcb_act_bias;

This callback implements custom actuator biases: it must return the bias for the specified actuator with
``mjModel.actuator_biastype`` set to mjBIAS_USER. If such actuators exist in the model and this callback is not
installed, their biases are set to 0.

.. _glCollision:

Collision table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _mjCOLLISIONFUNC:

mjCOLLISIONFUNC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern mjfCollision mjCOLLISIONFUNC[mjNGEOMTYPES][mjNGEOMTYPES];

Table of pairwise collision functions indexed by geom types. Only the upper-right triangle is used. The user can replace
these function pointers with custom routines, replacing MuJoCo's collision mechanism. If a given entry is NULL, the
corresponding pair of geom types cannot be collided. Note that these functions apply only to near-phase collisions. The
broadphase mechanism is built-in and cannot be modified.

.. _glString:

String constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The string constants described here are provided for user convenience. They correspond to the English names of lists of
options, and can be displayed in menus or dialogs in a GUI. The code sample :ref:`simulate.cc <saSimulate>` illustrates
how they can be used.

.. _mjDISABLESTRING:

.. _mjVISSTRING:

mjVISSTRING
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern const char* mjVISSTRING[mjNVISFLAG][3];

| Descriptions of the abstract visualization flags defined by :ref:`mjtVisFlag`. For each flag there are three strings,
  with the following meaning:

| [0]: flag name;

| [1]: the string "0" or "1" indicating if the flag is on or off by default, as set by
  :ref:`mjv_defaultOption`;

| [2]: one-character string with a suggested keyboard shortcut, used in :ref:`simulate.cc <saSimulate>`.

.. _mjRNDSTRING:

mjRNDSTRING
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   extern const char* mjRNDSTRING[mjNRNDFLAG][3];

Descriptions of the OpenGL rendering flags defined by :ref:`mjtRndFlag`. The three strings for each flag have the same
format as above, except the defaults here are set by :ref:`mjv_makeScene`.

.. _glNumeric:

Numeric constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Many integer constants were already documented in the primitive types above. In addition, the header files define
  several other constants documented here. Unless indicated otherwise, each entry in the table below is defined in
  mjmodel.h. Note that some extended key codes are defined in mjui.h which are not shown in the table below. Their names
  are in the format mjKEY_XXX. They correspond to GLFW key codes.

+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| symbol           | value  | description                                                                            |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMINVAL         | 1E-15  | The minimal value allowed in any denominator, and in general any mathematical          |
|                  |        | operation where 0 is not allowed. In almost all cases, MuJoCo silently clamps smaller  |
|                  |        | values to mjMINVAL.                                                                    |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjPI             | pi     | The value of pi. This is used in various trigonometric functions, and also for         |
|                  |        | conversion from degrees to radians in the compiler.                                    |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXVAL         | 1E+10  | The maximal absolute value allowed in mjData.qpos, mjData.qvel, mjData.qacc. The API   |
|                  |        | functions :ref:`mj_checkPos`, :ref:`mj_checkVel`, :ref:`mj_checkAcc` use this constant |
|                  |        | to detect instability.                                                                 |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMINMU          | 1E-5   | The minimal value allowed in any friction coefficient. Recall that MuJoCo's contact    |
|                  |        | model allows different number of friction dimensions to be included, as specified by   |
|                  |        | the :at:`condim`    attribute. If however a given friction dimension is included, its  |
|                  |        | friction is not allowed to be smaller than this constant. Smaller values are           |
|                  |        | automatically clamped to this constant.                                                |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMINIMP         | 0.0001 | The minimal value allowed in any constraint impedance. Smaller values are              |
|                  |        | automatically clamped to this constant.                                                |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXIMP         | 0.9999 | The maximal value allowed in any constraint impedance. Larger values are automatically |
|                  |        | clamped to this constant.                                                              |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXCONPAIR     | 50     | The maximal number of contacts points that can be generated per geom pair. MuJoCo's    |
|                  |        | built-in collision functions respect this limit, and user-defined functions should     |
|                  |        | also respect it. Such functions are called with a return buffer of size mjMAXCONPAIR;  |
|                  |        | attempting to write more contacts in the buffer can cause unpredictable behavior.      |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXVFS         | 200    | The maximal number of files in the virtual file system.                                |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXVFSNAME     | 100    | The maximal number of characters in the name of each file in the virtual file system.  |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNEQDATA        | 11     | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define each equality constraint.  |
|                  |        | Determines the size of mjModel.eq_data. This and the next five constants correspond to |
|                  |        | array sizes which we have not fully settled. There may be reasons to increase them in  |
|                  |        | the future, so as to accommodate extra parameters needed for more elaborate            |
|                  |        | computations. This is why we maintain them as symbolic constants that can be easily    |
|                  |        | changed, as opposed to the array size for representing quaternions for example - which |
|                  |        | has no reason to change.                                                               |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNDYN           | 10     | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define the activation dynamics of |
|                  |        | each actuator. Determines the size of mjModel.actuator_dynprm.                         |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNGAIN          | 10     | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define the gain of each actuator. |
|                  |        | Determines the size of mjModel.actuator_gainprm.                                       |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNBIAS          | 10     | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define the bias of each actuator. |
|                  |        | Determines the size of mjModel.actuator_biasprm.                                       |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNREF           | 2      | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define the reference acceleration |
|                  |        | of each scalar constraint. Determines the size of all mjModel.XXX_solref fields.       |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNIMP           | 5      | The maximal number of real-valued parameters used to define the impedance of each      |
|                  |        | scalar constraint. Determines the size of all mjModel.XXX_solimp fields.               |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNSOLVER        | 1000   | The size of the preallocated array ``mjData.solver``. This is used to store diagnostic |
|                  |        | information about each iteration of the constraint solver. The actual number of        |
|                  |        | iterations is given by ``mjData.solver_iter``.                                         |
+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjNGROUP         | 6      | The number of geom, site, joint, tendon and actuator groups whose rendering can be     |

+------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mjMAXLINEPNT     | 1000   | The maximal number of points in each line in a 2D figure. Note that the buffer         |
|                  |        | mjvFigure.linepnt has length 2*mjMAXLINEPNT because each point has X and Y             |
|                  |        | coordinates. Defined in mjvisualize.h.                                                 |

API functions
-------------

The main header `mujoco.h <https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/include/mujoco/mujoco.h>`_ exposes a very large
number of functions. However the functions that most users are likely to need are a small fraction. For example,
:ref:`simulate.cc <saSimulate>` which is as elaborate as a MuJoCo application is likely to get, calls around 40 of these
functions, while ``basic.cc`` calls around 20. The rest are explosed just in case someone has a use for them. This
includes us as users of MuJoCo -- we do our own work with the public library instead of relying on internal builds.

Macros
^^^^^^

.. _mjMARKSTACK:

mjMARKSTACK
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjMARKSTACK int _mark = d->pstack;

This macro is helpful when using the MuJoCo stack in custom computations. It works together with the next macro and the
:ref:`mj_stackAlloc` function, and assumes that mjData\* d is defined. The use pattern is this:

::

       mjMARKSTACK
       mjtNum* temp = mj_stackAlloc(d, 100);
       // ... use temp as needed
       mjFREESTACK

.. _mjFREESTACK:

mjFREESTACK
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjFREESTACK d->pstack = _mark;

Reset the MuJoCo stack pointer to the variable \_mark, normally saved by mjMARKSTACK.

.. _mjDISABLED:

mjDISABLED
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjDISABLED(x) (m->opt.disableflags & (x))

Check if a given standard feature has been disabled via the physics options, assuming mjModel\* m is defined. x is of
type :ref:`mjtDisableBit`.

.. _mjENABLED:

mjENABLED
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjENABLED(x) (m->opt.enableflags & (x))

Check if a given optional feature has been enabled via the physics options, assuming mjModel\* m is defined. x is of
type :ref:`mjtEnableBit`.

.. _mjMAX:

mjMAX
~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjMAX(a,b) (((a) > (b)) ? (a) : (b))

Return maximum value. To avoid repeated evaluation with mjtNum types, use the function :ref:`mju_max`.

.. _mjMIN:

mjMIN
~~~~~

.. code-block:: C

   #define mjMIN(a,b) (((a) < (b)) ? (a) : (b))

Return minimum value. To avoid repeated evaluation with mjtNum types, use the function :ref:`mju_min`.

**How to ask for help**

- Take a step back and tell us what you're trying to accomplish, and in what context. The more information you give, the better the answers you will get.

- If relevant, include a ***minimal*** model that demonstrates the problem. If the model is small, include it as inline XML. If it requires binary assets, attach it as a zip file.

- Include a screenshot or video, if relevant.
